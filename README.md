## Section 1 - Overview 
- This is an application that I was hesitant on doing at first, but turned out to be very fun to make, I also was more familiar with the bootstrap library. So it was extremely fun to create. The theme that I focused around was Marvel Superheros. I chose these simply because I think they are funny.

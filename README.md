# --GIF-App--

## Section 1 - Overview 
- This is an application that I was hesitant on doing at first, but turned out to be very fun to make, I also was more familiar with the bootstrap library. So it was extremely fun to create. The theme that I focused around was Marvel Superheros. I chose these simply because I think they are funny. 


## Section 2 - Purpose 
- The purpose of this application was to utilize AJAX GET requests and to use them to the best of my ability to get the application up and running using some form of a database but without a backend.


## Section 3 - Directions
1. User visits the application.
2. The user clicks on the super hero they want to view GIFs of.
3. The user then searches the GIFs that show up and enjoys the gif, can copy / paste wherever. 
4. The user can then go back and choose a differently desired GIF that would be used preferably to be viewed. 
5. The user then repeats steps 2-4.


## Section 4 - Notes 
- No current notes. 


## Section 5 - Summary 
- As mentioned in the overview, I really enjoyed this project / application and I hope to use the AJAX feature alot more with other APIs. I realized there are alot of amazing APIs out there that are open sourced. and it would be amazing to build on top of these other APIs!

# --GIF-App--

## Section 1 - Overview 
- This is an application that I was hesitant on doing at first, but turned out to be very fun to make, I also was more familiar with the bootstrap library. So it was extremely fun to create. The theme that I focused around was Marvel Superheros. I chose these simply because I think they are funny. 


## Section 2 - Purpose 
- The purpose of this application was to utilize AJAX GET requests and to use them to the best of my ability to get the application up and running using some form of a database but without a backend.


## Section 3 - Directions
1. User visits the application.
2. The user clicks on the super hero they want to view GIFs of.
3. The user then searches the GIFs that show up and enjoys the gif, can copy / paste wherever.
